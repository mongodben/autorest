- [Modelerfour](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/main/packages/extensions/modelerfour/CHANGELOG.md)

## Directive debugging

A new property `debug` has been added on directive which will enable additional logging when the directive is running.

Usage:

```yaml
directive:
  from: openapi-document
  where: $.definitions.Foo
  debug: true
  transform: |
    $.readOnly = true;
```

Autorest will now log which documents, paths, inital values of each instance before executing the transform and resulting value after.

## End of line configuration

New configuration `eol` which lets you configure the end of line regardless of the system autorest is being run on.

Usage:

```yaml
eol: lf # Force unix line ending
eol: crlf # Force windows line ending
eol: default # Keep system default
```

## Performance improvements

Autorest core 3.5.0 introduce some improvements on the memory management reducing its overall usage. This is mostly notable for very large specs.

A new flag was added(`--memory`) which can be used to configure the max memory autorest is allowed to used.

Usage:

```yaml
memory: 8g # Allow up to 8GB of memory
```
